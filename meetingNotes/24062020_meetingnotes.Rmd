B. Casault, E. Chisholm, C. Layton, C. Johnson, M. McMahon

## Meeting Minutes

### Discussion around Benoit's document

![Figure 1. Organizational chart for structure of azmpdata](supp_files/azmpdata_chart.png)


![Figure 2. Comments from Benoit on organizational chart / azmpdata structure.](supp_files/azmpdata_comments.png)




* The structure of azmpdata (fig 1) makes sense to all team members
* CIL and other non- depth-dependent variablesx will fit into derived/plankton category (fig 1)
  * This box may need to branch off to include broad scale shelf data metrics
  * This would also include climate metrics  eg AMO (annual, broad scale metrics)

* Some variables will be listed as lower priority and structure can be expanded later to fit, but the structure should be robust enough to include future modifications
* Remote sensing products
  * want to avoid multivaR or other packages having to grab products from ftp servers
  * would fit best in blue data structure box (fig 1)
  * single values for statistical boxes, no sample IDs or event IDs may need work around
  
* There is a certain compromise on file size which is balanced well

* varibale naming scheme
  * would BODC or another standard vairable naming scheme be able to incorporate these metrics? likely only discrete..
  * There is large benefit in brevity of variable names
  * __EC will compile a list of variable names and circulate for discussion__
  * any ambiguity will be resolved in data documentation
  * should create look up table or style sheet
  * discrete vs derived variables should be clear from naming
  * look at intl standards from ICES, NOAA, BODC, etc
  * potential to translate between naming schemes if needed
  
* data frame naming scheme
  * using 'matrix'
  * seperated by underscores
  * first part of name defines variable type : discrete, derived, zooplankton, phytoplankton
  * second part of name defines temporal scale: occupations, annual
  * third part of name defines spatial scale: stations, sections, broadscale
  * example name would be discrete_annual_stations.csv or derived_annual_broadscale.csv
  
* depth measures
  * sampling depth and nominal depth should be included with data
  * nominal depth is used for merging data
  * sampling depth is often required for calculations eg. integrated chl
  
* anomolies
  * will not be calculated in azmpdata
  * CL and BC both have anomoly scripts
  * __EC will gather scripts, compare and bring any discrepancies/conflicts to the group for attention__
  * __EC will create new anomoly function for multivaR__
  
* Data from Peter
  * Ice, NAO, AMO, RivSum
  
* Metadata files
  * BC has created metadata file for HL2, P5 should be a simple addition
  * these files contain 'nuts and bolts' detail info like sample IDs, precise lat and lon, event numbers etc
  * They also include ODF filenames for reference to TS
  * will be linked to data files through event and sample IDs
  * would be mostly used by behind the scenes processers such as Benoit, not necessary for average user
  * BC says they are easy to maintain
  * Will be included for completeness and in case the info is needed for more detailed analyses
  
### UPDATES

* CJ presented to working group
* CL and BC have been quite busy but hope to dedicate more time over the next month
* EC has been investigating questions from previous meetings and creating task list for multivaR

* BC shared RNOAA package, NOAA data access repo which team members will look at for any inspiration

### NEXT STEPS
* Assembling csv's (BC/CL)
* AZMP search and vis code
* next meeting July 8th 2pm
