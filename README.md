# *azmpdata*

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The R package *azmpdata* provides a series of data products derived from
raw data collected as part of the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program
([AZMP](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/data-donnees/azmp-pmza/index-eng.html)).
The data products provided in this package are used to generate the
different figures contained in the Research Documents produced annually
by Fisheries and Ocean Canadaâ€™s Maritimes region. The Research Documents
describe the physical, chemical and biological conditions observed in
Maritimes region since the inception of the AZMP program (see example
documents for the
[physical](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2018/2018_016-eng.html)
conditions and for the [optical, chemical and
biological](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2018/2018_017-eng.html)
conditions).

## Package Installation

The *azmpdata* R package can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("casaultb/azmpdata")
```

## Datasets

The *azmpdata* package provides three categories of data products:
physical, biological and chemical variables, which are summarized below.
Each data product is provided as a data frame (in the *azmpdata/data*
folder) or as a csv file (in the *azmpdata/data-raw* folder).

#### Physical Data Products

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- library(tibble) -->

<!-- library(knitr) -->

<!-- ``` -->

#### Chemical Data Products

| Dataset                             | Description                                          |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| nitrate\_inventory\_timeseries\_hl2 | Timeseries of nitrate inventory at Halifax-2 station |

#### Biological Data Products

| Dataset                                    | Description                                                |
| :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| chlorophyll\_inventory\_timeseries\_hl2    | Timeseries of chlorophyll inventory at Halifax-2 station   |
| chlorophyll\_inventory\_annual\_means\_hl2 | Annual means of chlorophyll inventory at Halifax-2 station |

## Package Functionality

Although the main goal of *azmpdata* is to provide easy access to a
variety of data products, the package also supports a few basic
functions for which examples are shown below.

#### Dataset Documentation

A detailed description of the whole package is available using the
following command:

``` r
library(azmpdata)
help("azmpdata")
```

In addition, each dataset is documented and the following command
returns a detailed description about a given dataset:

``` r
library(azmpdata)
help("chlorophyll_inventory_timeseries_hl2")
```

#### Keyword Search

The function *search\_azmpdata* allows to look up which datasets match a
certain keyword criterion. For example, the following command returns
all the datasets containing *chlorophyll* data:

``` r
library(azmpdata)
search_azmpdata("chlorophyll")
#> [1] "chlorophyll_inventory_annual_means_hl2"
#> [2] "chlorophyll_inventory_timeseries_hl2"
```
